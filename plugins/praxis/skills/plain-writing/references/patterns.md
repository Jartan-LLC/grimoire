# Wording patterns

The wording pass in `SKILL.md` reads this list after the content is settled. Each pattern is a
habit that adds words without adding a fact. Fix it by stating the point directly; never add a
fact, drop one a reader needs, or reorder steps while doing so.

- Act on one sighting of any pattern not marked *weak alone*; patterns 1-5 are the most frequent.
  A pattern marked *weak alone* needs other patterns in the same passage before you act.
- In informational text, keep the structure readers scan: headings they look up, a label that
  names what each list item is, tables, code, commands, paths and link targets. Pattern 19 is
  about bold used for decoration, not those labels.
- The project's own style rules override any pattern they speak to, and an edited file's dashes,
  quotes and heading case override pattern 8, pattern 21 and pattern 20's heading case, as
  `SKILL.md` says.

## A. Staging instead of stating

These are the most frequent tells in current model prose.

### 1. Not X but Y

**Watch for:** not X but Y; not just, not only, or not merely X, but Y; it's not X, it's Y; the reversed form X rather than Y; the same contrast split across sentences ("This does not mean X. It means Y."); a clipped negative tail ("..., no guessing"). The formula appears in every language; treat the equivalent construction the same way.
**Problem:** The negative half names something no one claimed, so the positive half sounds larger. It adds weight without adding a claim. State the point directly. Keep a contrast only when the negative half corrects a belief the reader actually holds, or when both halves carry information.
**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.

**After:**
> The beat under the vocals adds to the aggression and atmosphere.

**Before (split across sentences):**
> This does not mean every choice is equal. It means there is no external system that confirms which choice is right.

**After:**
> No external system confirms which choice is right.

**Before (clipped tail):**
> The options come from the selected item, no guessing.

**After:**
> The options come from the selected item.

### 2. One-line closers and dramatic fragments

**Watch for:** a one-sentence paragraph that restates the paragraph before it; "That is the real win."; "That distinction matters."; "Read that again."; "Let that sink in."; the same closer after several sections; a sentence after an example, scene, or number that names what it showed ("This shows the importance of...", "The message was clear:", "It was a lesson in patience."); a row of fragments ("No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia."); one word in ALL CAPS or with periods between words (every. single. day.).
**Problem:** The line asks the reader to pause on a claim instead of adding to it. One short sentence can carry emphasis when it carries a new fact. Cut a closer that repeats, including one that explains an example the reader just saw. Keep it when it adds a fact or consequence the example does not show. Merge a row of fragments into a sentence with a specific claim.
**Before:**
> Then AlphaEvolve arrived. It had no preference for symmetry. No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia for human taste. The old rules were gone.

**After:**
> AlphaEvolve had no aesthetic preferences, symmetry and human taste included, and the old rules stopped applying.

**Before (repeated closer):**
> Caching cuts repeat work.
>
> That is the real win.
>
> Retries hide brief outages.
>
> That is the real win.

**After:**
> Caching cuts repeat work.
>
> Retries hide brief outages.

### 3. Sayings that sound deep

**Watch for:** the real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter, X is the Y of Z, X becomes a trap, X is not a tool but a mirror, the language of, the currency of, the architecture of
**Problem:** An ordinary point is dressed as a hidden truth or an aphorism, and the dressing adds no detail. Replace the saying with the specific claim the text supports; if it supports none, cut it.
**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.

**After:**
> The question is whether teams can adapt; organizational readiness matters most.

**Before (aphorism):**
> Symmetry is the language of trust. Efficiency becomes a trap when teams forget the human layer.

**After:**
> (Cut both sentences unless the text says what it means by them.)

### 4. Staged run-up before the point

**Watch for:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado, heads up, quick note, Honestly?, Look, Here's the thing, The thing is, Let's be honest, Real talk, and casual versions such as "one thing that bit me, so pay attention"
**Problem:** The writer announces the point or stages a moment of candor instead of making the point. Remove the run-up, not just its tone. "Honestly" or "look" inside a casual sentence is ordinary; the tell is the standalone opener before a routine claim.
**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know.

**After:**
> (Cut both sentences and start with the first fact about Next.js caching.)

**Before (staged candor):**
> Is it worth the price? Honestly? It depends on how often you'll use it.

**After:**
> Whether it's worth the price depends on how often you'll use it.

### 5. Arguing with no one

**Watch for:** This isn't (mainly) about, I'm not saying, To be clear, Don't get me wrong, This is not to say, Some might say... but, A tempting approach would be, One might be tempted to, An obvious approach would be, You might think... but, It would be easy to just
**Problem:** The text answers an objection or rejects an option that appears nowhere else, usually a leftover from an earlier draft. Remove the defense; if it holds a real claim, state the claim. Keep an objection the text attributes or answers in full, and keep an option a reader would actually weigh. Several unrelated rejections in a row are a stronger sign than one.
**Before:**
> This isn't mainly about prompt length, and I'm not arguing that documentation doesn't matter. You could categorize the problem another way, but the issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.

**After:**
> The issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.

**Before (fake alternative):**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours. A tempting approach would be to rotate them by restarting the auth service on a cron job, but that would drop every active session. Rotation happens in place, and clients refresh transparently.

**After:**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours, in place, and clients refresh transparently.

## B. Rhythm by rule

Shapes and punctuation applied everywhere, whether or not the meaning asks for them.

### 6. Forced triads

**Problem:** Ideas arrive in threes to sound complete, whether the meaning has three parts or not. The tell can be one sentence ("innovation, inspiration, and insights"), three parallel examples, or three short facts followed by a lesson. Check that each item adds a distinct idea. Merge examples, keep the strongest one, or vary the structure when they do not. Keep three real items when the meaning needs three.
**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes keynote sessions, panel discussions and networking.

**Before (paragraph scale):**
> A career can look promising and fail. A relationship can feel important and end. A skill can take years and remain useless. These decisions rarely explain themselves.

**After:**
> A career choice can look promising and fail; such decisions rarely explain themselves.

### 7. Repeated sentence openings

**Problem:** Several sentences in a row start with the same subject, often *she* or *he*, because repetition is handled by rule instead of by ear. Merge the sentences, change the subject, or begin with the action. Do not ban the repeated word; a remaining sentence may still start with "She." Writers also repeat an opening on purpose for rhythm, as in "She came. She saw. She conquered."
**Before:**
> She noted the door. She noted the lock on it. She filed both away.

**After:**
> She noted the door and its lock, then filed both away.

### 8. Dashes as the universal connector

**Rule:** In text you write, replace each em dash or en dash with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses, or rewrite the sentence. This includes spaced dashes and double hyphens (` -- `) used as dashes. Leave dashes and hyphens inside code blocks, inline code, commands, paths, and URLs alone. Exception: where the writer's sample or the project's style uses dashes (a pure-ASCII project may write ` -- `), match its rate instead.
**Problem:** A dash lets the writer skip choosing how two clauses relate, so a model reaches for it everywhere. Many editors and journalists also use dashes, so in text you were handed or are reviewing, one dash is *weak alone*; a text full of them is the tell.
**Before:**
> The new policy -- announced without warning -- affects thousands of workers. The changes -- long overdue according to critics -- will take effect immediately.

**After:**
> The new policy, announced without warning, affects thousands of workers. The changes, long overdue according to critics, will take effect immediately.

### 9. Stacked qualifiers

**Watch for:** to be fair, it's also possible, could potentially, might arguably, in some cases it may, this is an inference
**Problem:** Repeated editing adds one qualifier after another until every claim sounds uncertain, usually to repair an earlier overstatement rather than to report real doubt. Keep a qualifier only when the source supports it and the meaning needs it. Keep scope statements, legal and safety notices, and real corrections. Ordinary hedges such as *perhaps* or *tends to* are human habits and not tells. *Weak alone.*
**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.

### 10. Hyphenated pairs everywhere

**Watch for:** high-quality, well-known, well-documented, long-term, real-time, client-facing after the noun they describe
**Problem:** Compound modifiers keep their hyphen in every position. Keep the hyphen before a noun, as in `a high-quality report`, and drop it after the noun, as in `the report is high quality`. Words the dictionary always spells with a hyphen, such as third-party and cross-functional, keep it everywhere. *Weak alone.*
**Before:**
> The report is high-quality, the process is well-documented, and the plan is long-term.

**After:**
> The report is high quality, the process is well documented, and the plan is long term.

### 11. Passive voice and missing subjects

**Problem:** The text hides who acts or drops the subject. Use active voice when it makes the actor and action clearer. *Weak alone.*
**Before:**
> No configuration file needed. The results are preserved automatically by the sync job.

**After:**
> You do not need a configuration file. The sync job preserves the results automatically.

## C. Inflation and borrowed authority

The fact underneath is usually sound. Keep it and remove the dressing.

### 12. Overused AI words

**Watch for:** Actually, additionally, align with, bolstered, crucial, deep dive, delve, enduring, enhance, garner, gate/gated/gating (figurative; keep technical uses), highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), meticulous/meticulously, pivotal, quietly, robust (figurative; keep technical uses), showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant
**Problem:** Models use these words far more often than people do, especially in groups. The watch lists in patterns 13 to 18 hold phrases that are tells because of how they are used; this list holds words that are tells in any sentence, within the use each entry names. A formal word outside these lists is not a tell by itself.
**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.

**After:**
> Somali cuisine also includes camel meat. Pasta, a sign of Italian colonial influence, is widely eaten in Somalia.

### 13. Inflated significance

**Watch for:** stands as a testament, a pivotal or crucial moment, plays a key role, marking or shaping the, underscores its importance, reflects a broader, enduring or lasting legacy, setting the stage for, evolving landscape, indelible mark; Despite these challenges... continues to thrive, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook, Awards and recognition; the future looks bright, exciting times ahead, a step in the right direction
**Problem:** An ordinary detail is said to mark a change, prove a legacy, or promise a future. The move appears at three scales: a phrase, a stock "challenges and outlook" section, and a send-off paragraph. Keep the fact and drop the significance. End on the last concrete fact; if the source states real plans, use those.
**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989, part of a wider decentralization of administrative functions in Spain.

**Before (stock section):**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including traffic congestion and water scarcity. Despite these challenges, with its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of Chennai's growth.

**After:**
> Korattur, an industrial area of Chennai, has traffic congestion and water scarcity.

**Before (send-off):**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence.

**After:**
> (Cut the paragraph. End on the last concrete fact.)

### 14. Vague connection or association

**Watch for:** associated with, in association with, connected to, in connection with, linked to, tied to
**Problem:** The text says two things are connected without saying how. "He was associated with the leadership of ExampleCorp" hides whether he was the CEO, a board member, or a consultant. Name the relationship the source gives. If the source does not say, keep the vague wording rather than inventing a role.
**Before:**
> He is associated with the Rajhans Orchestra, which he founded and conducts. The concerts were organised in connection with the celebrations of Pakistan's 50th anniversary.

**After:**
> He founded and conducts the Rajhans Orchestra. The concerts were organised in connection with the celebrations of Pakistan's 50th anniversary.

### 15. Shallow -ing riders

**Watch for:** highlighting, underscoring, emphasizing, ensuring, reflecting, symbolizing, contributing to, cultivating, fostering, encompassing, showcasing
**Problem:** An -ing phrase is bolted onto a simple fact to make it sound deeper. Attaching it to a named source ("Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence") does not make it true. Keep the fact; keep the rider only when the source supports what it claims.
**Before:**
> The temple's color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land.

**After:**
> The temple's blue, green, and gold stand for Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Texan landscapes.

### 16. Sales language

**Watch for:** rich (figurative), profound, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, featuring, diverse array, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning
**Problem:** The text reads like an advertisement, especially for places, culture, products, or organizations. State what the thing is.
**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.

**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia.

### 17. Borrowed authority

**Watch for:** experts argue, observers have cited, industry reports, some critics, several publications; cited, featured, or profiled in [a list of outlets], trade publications, independent coverage; active social media presence, over N followers
**Problem:** A name or an unnamed authority stands in for what was said. Unnamed experts prop up a claim; a list of prestige outlets props up a person. When the source text names the real source and what it said, use that. Otherwise cut the unsupported claim or the list. A missing citation alone is not a tell; most writing is unsourced.
**Before (unnamed authority):**
> Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.

**After:**
> The Haolai River interests researchers and conservationists for its unusual characteristics.

**Before (prestige list):**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu. She maintains an active social media presence with over 500,000 followers.

**After:**
> (Cut both sentences unless the source says what the outlets reported.)

### 18. Avoiding is, are, and has

**Watch for:** serves as, stands as, functions as, operates as, marks, represents [a]; boasts, features, offers, maintains [a]; refers to
**Problem:** Simple verbs are replaced with longer phrases. Use *is*, *are*, and *has*.
**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four separate spaces and over 3,000 square feet.

## D. Formatting by rule

Templates and visual editors also produce clean formatting. The tell is decoration on every item.

### 19. Bold as decoration

**Problem:** Words are bolded without a reason, and vertical lists give every item a bold label and a colon. Remove the bold. Turn a labeled list into prose when the labels carry no information of their own.
**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.

**After:**
> It blends OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and visual strategy tools such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC).

**Before (labeled list):**

- **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
- **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
- **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.

**After:**
> A new interface improves the user experience, optimized algorithms improve performance, and end-to-end encryption improves security.

### 20. Decorative headings

**Problem:** Headings capitalize every main word, and headings or list items carry emojis or arrow characters as decoration. A horizontal rule sits between every section, or the document opens with a top-level heading that repeats its own title. A heading written for effect ("The decision, on one screen") should name what the section holds ("How the six options compare"). Use sentence case, remove the decoration and the rules, and let the title stand once.
**Before:**

```markdown
## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships
```

**After:**

```markdown
## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships
```

**Before (emojis):**
> [rocket emoji] **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
>
> [light bulb emoji] **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity

**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. Users prefer simplicity.

### 21. Curly quotation marks

**Problem:** Curly (typographic) quotation marks appear where the writer or target format uses straight quotes ("..."). Most editors auto-curl, so this is *weak alone*.
**Before:**
> He said [curly open quote]the project is on track[curly close quote] but others disagreed.

**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.

## E. Leftovers from the chat and the draft

Remove the wrapper; keep any fact or caveat it carries, as each pattern says.

### 22. Chatbot residue

**Watch for:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, Great question!, You're absolutely right, Would you like..., Want me to...?, Should I continue?, let me know, here is a...
**Problem:** A chatbot's greeting, praise, offer, or closing remains in text that should stand on its own. It is the most certain tell in this list and the easiest to miss when it wraps real content. Remove the wrapper and keep the content.
**Before:**
> Great question! Here is an overview of the French Revolution. It began in 1789 when a financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.

**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when a financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.

### 23. Knowledge-limit disclaimers and guesses

**Watch for:** as of my last update, up to my last training update, while specific details are limited, based on available information, not publicly available, not widely documented or disclosed, maintains a low profile, keeps personal details private, likely [grew up, studied, began], it is believed that
**Problem:** The text mentions where the model's knowledge ends, or admits it found no source and then fills the gap with a plausible guess. State what the source does not show, or remove the sentence. A dated statement of a fact, such as a deprecation notice or an advisory, is not this pattern, and saying plainly what the sources do not show is the fix, not the tell.
**Before (cutoff disclaimer):**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.

**After:**
> The company's founding date is not documented in the available sources. (Or cut the sentence.)

**Before (guess):**
> Information about her early life is not publicly available, suggesting she maintains a low profile. She likely grew up in a middle-class household, which shaped her later interest in education reform.

**After:**
> Her early life is not documented in the available sources. (Or omit the section.)

### 24. A heading repeated in the first sentence

**Problem:** A heading is followed by a one-line paragraph that restates it before the real content begins. Remove the repeated sentence.
**Before:**

```markdown
## Performance

Speed matters.

When users hit a slow page, they leave.
```

**After:**

```markdown
## Performance

When users hit a slow page, they leave.
```

### 25. Writing about the document instead of its subject

**Watch for:** what the text replaced ("was added to replace"); how it was assembled or sourced ("generated from", "compiled from", "anything unconfirmed is flagged rather than guessed"); a legend, layout, or order the reader can already see ("the table below compares", "this section is organized by owner").
**Problem:** The text describes itself instead of its subject. Mention a previous version only in change logs, release notes, migration guides, and other documents about change. Keep a source credit the reader can follow; cut the account of how you worked. Keep a caveat that changes what the reader should do. State a convention only when the reader cannot infer it, and state it once. A single description of the page is *weak alone*.
**Before:**
> This function was added to replace the previous approach of iterating through all items, which caused O(n^2) performance.

**After:**
> This function avoids the O(n^2) cost of iterating through all items.

**Before (method narration):**
> The figures below are drawn from each vendor's published pricing; anything we could not confirm is flagged rather than guessed.

**After:**
> Prices are each vendor's published rate; figures that could not be confirmed are marked.
